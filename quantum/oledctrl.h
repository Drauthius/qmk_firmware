 * OLEDCTRL_CMD_SET_UP:
 *   This is equivalent to clear, but also returns the number of characters
 *   that can be written to the screen in the fourth and fifth bytes of the
 *   response (columns and rows, respectively).
 *
 * OLEDCTRL_CMD_CLEAR:
 *   Clear the entire screen. Depending on how oled_task_user() looks, this might
 *   revert the screen to its "default" (uncontrolled) state.
 *
 * OLEDCTRL_CMD_SET_LINE:
 *   Set the content of a line (row) of the screen. The fourth byte should be which
 *   line to modify, and the fifth byte and onwards should be content that is
 *   desired on that line. Will replace everything on that line, and will not
 *   wrap to the next one.
 *
 * OLEDCTRL_CMD_SET_CHARS:
 *   Set a portion of the screen. The fourth byte should be the offset, the fifth byte
 *   the length of the string, and the sixth byte and onwards should be the string to
 *   set. Will replace only until the length, and will wrap if it goes over a line.
 *
 * OLEDCTRL_CMD_PRESENT:
 *   Show the changes to the screen. This has to be called after the desired
 *   number of OLEDCTRL_CMD_SET_LINE commands have been issued. Think of it as double
 *   buffering, where this command will present the content of the back buffer.
